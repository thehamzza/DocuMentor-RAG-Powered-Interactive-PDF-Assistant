# DocuMentor: RAG-Powered Interactive PDF Assistant
# A Semantic Document Analysis and Information Retrieval System

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the Semantic Document Analysis and Information Retrieval System, 
a cutting-edge solution designed to redefine how we interact with PDF documents.
This system not only allows users to submit PDFs and ask questions directly from the document's content 
but also employs advanced technologies to ensure the answers are precise and derived from the content itself.

## Overview

This system was developed to enhance the discoverability and accessibility of information within a vast collection of documents. 
By leveraging state-of-the-art technologies in natural language processing and vector database management, 
we've created a platform that significantly improves the efficiency of information retrieval and analysis processes.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Query System**: Allows users to input PDF documents and pose questions, receiving accurate, content-derived answers.
- **Advanced Technology Integration**: Combines Python, Pinecone for vector storage, and OpenAI's language models, with LangChain
- enhancing the document processing workflow.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Employs a RAG approach to extract and generate contextually relevant answers from documents,
- streamlining access to information.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Vector Storage**: Pinecone
- **Language Models**: OpenAI
- **Document Processing**: LangChain (PyPDFDirectoryLoader, RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter)
- **Environment Management**: dotenv

## Project Impact

This system is a testament to the potential of integrating AI and database management technologies to create powerful tools for researchers, 
professionals, and anyone in need of quick and reliable access to document-based information. It represents a significant step forward in making
vast datasets of documents searchable and interactive, thereby facilitating knowledge discovery and accelerating research and development 
activities across various fields.
